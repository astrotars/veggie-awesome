A veggie font and CSS toolkit

## Examples

Say you want to add an icon of cabbage on your page. I mean, who wouldn't? Following a FontAwesome like structure, do this:

```html
<i class="veg veg-cabbage"></i>
```

Ok.  That was easy.  Too easy. It's also too small for my page.  I forgot to mention, I needed a ridiculously big picture of cabbage on my page.

```html
<i class="veg veg-cabbage veg-5x"></i>
```

Wow. That's perfect.  Our multipliers go from `2x` to `5x`, so you have the control you hopefully need.  The multipliers run off of EMs.
